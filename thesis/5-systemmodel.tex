\chapter[System Model and Definitions]{System Model and Definitions}
\label{sec:sysmodel}

In this chapter, we present the system model, introduce two variations of a
multicast communication primitive, and define our correctness criterion (i.e.,
linearizability).

\section{Processes and communication}

We consider a distributed system consisting of an unbounded set of client
processes $\ccm = \{c_1, c_2, ...\}$ and a bounded set of server processes
(replicas) $\ssm = \{s_1, ..., s_n\}$.  Set $\ssm$ is divided into disjoint
groups of servers $\ssm_0, ..., \ssm_k$. Processes are either \emph{correct}, if
they never fail, or \emph{faulty}, otherwise.  In either case, processes do not
experience arbitrary behavior (i.e., no Byzantine failures).

Processes communicate by message passing, using either one-to-one or one-to-many
communication.  The system is asynchronous: there is no bound on message delay
or on relative process speed.  One-to-one communication uses primitives
$send(p,m)$ and $receive(m)$, where $m$ is a message and $p$ is the process $m$
is addressed to.  If sender and receiver are correct, then every message sent is
eventually received. One-to-many communication relies on reliable multicast and
atomic multicast.\footnote{Solving atomic multicast requires additional
assumptions~\cite{CT96,FLP85}. In the following, we simply assume the existence
of an atomic multicast oracle.} % defined in sections~\ref{sec:rmcast} and
\ref{sec:amcast}, respectively.


\subsection{Reliable multicast} \label{sec:rmcast}

To reliably multicast a message $m$ to a set of groups $\gamma$, processes use
primitive \rmcast$(\gamma, m)$.  Message $m$ is delivered at the destinations
with \rmdel$(m)$.  Reliable multicast has the following properties: (i)~If a
correct process \rmcast{}s $m$, then every correct process in $\gamma$ \rmdel{}s
$m$ \emph{(validity)}. (ii)~If a correct process \rmdel{}s $m$, then every
correct process in $\gamma$ \rmdel{}s $m$ \emph{(agreement)}. (iii)~For any
message $m$, every process $p$ in $\gamma$ \rmdel{}s $m$ at most once, and only
if some process has \rmcast{} $m$ to $\gamma$ previously \emph{(integrity)}.

\subsection{Atomic multicast} \label{sec:amcast}

To atomically multicast a message $m$ to a set of groups $\gamma$, processes use
primitive \amcast$(\gamma, m)$.  Message $m$ is delivered at the destinations
with \amdel$(m)$.  We define delivery order $<$ as follows: $m < m'$ iff there
exists a process that delivers $m$ before $m'$. Atomic multicast ensures the
following properties: (i)~If a correct process \amcast{}s $m$, every correct
process in a group in $\gamma$ \amdel{}s $m$ \emph{(validity)}. (ii)~If a
process \amdel{}s $m$, then every correct process in a group in $\gamma$
\amdel{}s $m$ \emph{(uniform agreement)}. (iii)~For any message $m$, every
process \amdel{}s $m$ at most once, and only if some process has \amcast{} $m$
previously \emph{(integrity)}. (iv)~If a process \amcast{}s $m$ and then $m'$,
then no process \amdel{}s $m'$ before $m$ \emph{(fifo order)}. (v)~The delivery
order is acyclic \emph{(atomic order)}. (vi)~For any messages $m$ and $m'$ and
any processes $p$ and $q$ such that $p \in g$, $q \in h$ and $\{ g, h \}
\subseteq \gamma$, if $p$ delivers $m$ and $q$ delivers $m'$, then either $p$
delivers $m'$ before $m$ or $q$ delivers $m$ before $m'$ \emph{(prefix order)}.
Atomic broadcast is a special case of atomic multicast in which there is a
single group of processes.

\section{State-machine replication}
\label{sec:smr}

State machine replication is a fundamental approach to implementing a
fault-tolerant service by replicating servers and coordinating the execution of
client commands against server replicas~\cite{Lam78,Sch90}. State machine
replication ensures strong consistency (i.e., linearizability~\cite{Attiya04})
by coordinating the execution of commands in the different replicas: Every
replica has a full copy of the service state $\vvm = \{v_1, ..., v_m\}$ and
executes commands submitted by the clients in the same order. To guarantee that
servers deliver the same sequence of commands, SMR can be implemented with
atomic broadcast: commands are atomically broadcast to all servers, and all
correct servers deliver and execute the same sequence of commands
\cite{BJ87b,DSU04}.
