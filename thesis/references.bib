abstract="We present a new class of Byzantine-tolerant State Machine Replication protocols for asynchronous environments that we term Byzantine Chain Replication. We demonstrate two implementations that present different trade-offs between performance and security, and compare these with related work. Leveraging an external reconfiguration service, these protocols are not based on Byzantine consensus, do not require majority-based quorums during normal operation, and the set of replicas is easy to reconfigure.",
