\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:dssmr-conclusion}
This chapter introduced \dssmr. It
proposes an approach that allows scaling state machine replication by
dynamically repartitioning application state based on the workload.  Variables
that are usually accessed together are moved to the same partition, which
significantly improves scalability. However, in order to reduce the chances of
skewed load among partitions in \dssmr\, the destination partition is chosen
randomly. Although this heuristic algorithm could bring a balanced partitioning,
it fails to guarantee optimal partitioning and to minimize the rate of
multi-partition commands. In the next chapter, we will discuss how
we can reach an optimized partitioning.
