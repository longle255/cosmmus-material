\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work introduces \dssmrlong{} (\dssmr), a scalable variant of the well-known state machine replication technique. 
\dssmr{} implements dynamic state partitioning to adapt to different access patterns throughout the execution, while scaling throughput with the number of partitions and ensuring linearizability.
To evaluate \dssmr{}, we developed the \libname\ library and implemented \appname{}, a scalable social network application, with \libname{}.
In our experiments, we deployed \appname\ with both \dssmr\ and \ssmr{}, executing the application with workloads with weak and strong locality.
The results demonstrate that \dssmr\ significantly improves the performance of \appname\ over \ssmr\ in the presence of multi-partition commands, specially for workloads with strong locality.
