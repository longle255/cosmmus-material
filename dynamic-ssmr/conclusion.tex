\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work introduces \dssmrlong{} (\dssmr), a scalable variant of the well-known
state machine replication technique. \dssmr{} implements dynamic state
partitioning to adapt to different access patterns throughout the execution,
while scaling throughput with the number of partitions and ensuring
linearizability. To evaluate \dssmr{}, we developed the \libname\ library and
implemented \appname{}, a scalable social network application, with \libname{}.
In our experiments, we deployed \appname\ with both \dssmr\ and \ssmr{}.
%, executing the application under workloads with weak and strong locality.
The results demonstrate that \dssmr\ significantly improves the performance of
\appname\ over \ssmr\ in the presence of multi-partition commands.
%, specially for workloads with strong locality.
