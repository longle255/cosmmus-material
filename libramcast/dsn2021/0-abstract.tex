Atomic multicast is a group communication abstraction useful in the design of highly available and scalable systems.
It allows messages to be addressed to a subset of the processes in the system reliably and consistently.
All existing atomic multicast algorithms to date are based on the message-passing model.
The paper presents \libname, the first atomic multicast protocol that uses shared memory by means of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA).
We design \libname by leveraging RDMA technology and by carefully
combining techniques from message-passing and shared-memory systems. 
We show experimentally that \libname outperforms current state-of-the-art atomic multicast protocols by up to 3.7$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 20$\times$.
