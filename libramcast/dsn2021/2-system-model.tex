\section{System model}
\label{sec:system-model}
We assume a distributed system composed of a set $\Pi = \{p_1, p_2, ...\}$  of
processes. We assume the \emph{crash} failure model. Processes are either
\emph{correct}, if they never fail, or \emph{faulty}, otherwise. In either case,
processes do not experience arbitrary behavior (i.e., no Byzantine failures).
Our protocols ensure safety under both asynchronous and synchronous execution
periods. To ensure liveness, we assume the system is \emph{partially
synchronous} \cite{DLS88}.

Processes communication is based on remote direct memory access, through the
message passing primitives \emph{send(p, m), receive(m)} and memory access
primitives \emph{read(p, m), write(p, m)}.
