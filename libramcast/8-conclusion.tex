Atomic multicast is a fundamental communication abstraction in the design of scalable and highly available strongly consistent distributed systems.
This paper presents \libname, the first genuine atomic multicast protocol tailor-made for the shared-memory model.
In addition to introducing a novel algorithm that leverages the permission mechanism of RDMA's write operations to reduce the number of communication steps, we also have implemented and evaluated the protocol under a large range of parameters.
The results show that \libname outperforms both a kernel-space atomic broadcast and a recent state-of-the-art message-passing genuine atomic multicast algorithm.
