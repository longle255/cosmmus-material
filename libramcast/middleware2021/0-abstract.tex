\begin{abstract}
Atomic multicast is a group communication abstraction useful in the design of highly available and scalable systems.
It allows messages to be addressed to a subset of the processes in the system reliably and consistently.
Many atomic multicast algorithms have been designed for the message-passing system model.
The paper presents \libname, the first atomic multicast protocol for the shared-memory system model.
We design \libname by leveraging Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technology and by carefully
combining techniques from message-passing and shared-memory systems. 
We show experimentally that \libname outperforms current state-of-the-art atomic multicast protocols, increasing throughput by up to 3.7$\times$ and reducing latency by up to 28$\times$.
