Atomic multicast is a group communication abstraction useful in the design of highly available and scalable systems.
It allows messages to be addressed to a subset of the processes in the system reliably and consistently.
All existing atomic multicast algorithm to date are based on the message-passing model.
The paper presents the first atomic multicast protocol that uses shared memory by means of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA).
We design atomic multicast by leveraging RDMA technology and by carefully
combining techniques from message passing and shared memory systems. This
implementation is significantly faster than prior systems.
