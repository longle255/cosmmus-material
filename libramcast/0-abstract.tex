Atomic multicast allows messages to be addressed to a subset of the processes in
the system. Atomic multicast ensures that the destination processes of every
message agree either to deliver or to not deliver the message, and no two
processes deliver any two messages in different order. We implement atomic
multicast by carefully leveraging RDMA, which enables a computer to access a
remote computer’s memory directly, without OS involvement on either side—by
combining a set of techniques from message passing and shared memory. This
implementation is significantly faster than prior systems.
