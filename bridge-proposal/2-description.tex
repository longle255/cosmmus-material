\subsection{Research background}

In this section, we briefly summarize the state-of-the-art in the proposed
research areas and outline the current state of the principal investigator own
research.

\subsubsection{Current state of research in the field}

Since the introduction of Bitcoin, the demand for blockchain-based solutions has
increased. A multitude of blockchain technologies have been proposed to address
different aspects of digital life. 
%In the core of most blockchains, essentially, assets are transferred under the control of custom
%scripts that enforce necessary conditions to transfer an asset from one party to another. 
Being the first generation of blockchain, Bitcoin essentially supports the
transferring of assets. Later generations of blockchain systems (e.g., Ethereum,
NEO, Stellar, Cosmos) have extended blockchains with support for \emph{smart
contracts}. Smart contracts provide a general-purpose programmable
infrastructure, where the blockchain does not only store financial data but also
has the capability of deploying and executing custom code. More technically,
smart contracts implement the abstraction of state machine replication. Ethereum
is after Bitcoin the second-largest cryptocurrency platform by market
capitalization. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum supports programmable smart contracts
with an entire programming language along with it, running in Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM) \cite{ethereum:evm}. The flexibility within a smart contract
allows users to implement their own autonomous execution logic on blockchains,
which enables more options for optimization. However, several challenges in
blockchain technology remain to be addressed, two of which are scalability and
interoperability.

\textbf{Scalability.} The performance of mainstream blockchains is still a
barrier to the adoption of blockchain technology. As a global payment system,
Visa is capable of processing around 24,000 transactions per second on average
\cite{visa}, while Bitcoin and Ethereum can handle 7 and 15 transactions per
second \cite{ethereum:sharding, nakamoto2019bitcoin}. Scaling the performance of
blockchain systems has become a hot topic for both industry and academia, with
many proposals. Those proposals vary from optimizing the performance of the
consensus protocols \cite{dang2019towards}, partitioning the blockchain
\cite{wang2019sok}, to shifting the computation from the blockchain (on-chain)
to the outside (off-chain) \cite{teutsch2019scalable, network2018cheap}. Among
all the proposed methods for scaling the performance, sharding the blockchain state
is an effective and practical solution, as it can overcome both performance and
scalability problems. Partitioning (or \emph{sharding}) is a
technique that divides the state of a service or a system in multiple partitions
so that most requests or transactions access one partition only and are equally
distributed among partitions (e.g., \cite{facebookTAO, sciascia2012sdur,
aguilera2007sinfonia}). As a result, partitions can work in parallel to maximize
performance and improve throughput. In the context of blockchain, state
partitioning is challenging.
%, however, due to fundamental differences between
%previous domains and blockchain, notably the failure model. 
With its decentralized nature, there is no single entity in a blockchain system that
contains information of all objects in the network, which makes it difficult for
blockchain clients to locate objects in the presence of partitioning. RapidChain
\cite{zamani2018rapidchain} builds a routing overlay network for users and
committee leaders to locate the committee where to send their transactions.
Moreover, with the lacking of overall information, choosing a partition to place
the objects in order to maximize the balance between partitions is not
effective. Even if enough information is available, finding a good partitioning
is a complex optimization problem~\cite{curino2010sch,taft2014est}. To the best
of our knowledge, no work has focused on achieving an optimized partitioning in the
context of blockchain.

\textbf{Interoperability.} With the increasing number of blockchain systems
and distributed applications (DApps), there is a rising demand for
interoperability. Interoperability in the context of blockchain means connecting
multiple blockchains to share, exchange, or change the state of the own or the
other blockchain \cite{buterin2016chain}. In the recent evolvement of blockchain
technologies, some blockchain systems have supported interoperability in their
core, in the form of an inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol
\cite{kwon2016cosmos, thomas2015protocol, kokoris2018omniledger,
al2017chainspace}. Moreover, some solutions start to appear that allow smart
contracts to move between existing blockchains \cite{fynn2020move,
back2014enabling, herlihy2018atomic}. In \cite{fynn2020move}, Fynn \emph{et al.}
introduced a move primitive \cite{fynn2020move} that allows programmable blockchains
to interoperate by moving contracts and data from one to another. The
possibilities of interoperability are endless. An application in a private
blockchain can access data from a public blockchain \cite{prusty2018blockchain},
A contract can shift an expensive computational off-chain
\cite{teutsch2019scalable, network2018cheap}, or a DApps can access data from
multiple blockchains. However, it also leaves new open questions. An important question is
how to locate objects in a multi-blockchain environment where objects can move from one
blockchain to another.
Another crucial question is how to optimize the economics of object placement.
This project will address both questions.

\subsubsection{Current state of principal investigator's research}

Investigator Long Hoang Le conducts research in distributed systems. Much of his
work has focused on scalable and fault-tolerant systems, particularly in the context of
state machine replication (SMR) \cite{le2016dssmr, le2019dynastar, bezerra2016strong}.
His work on scalable SMR \cite{le2016dssmr} was nominated for the best paper award at 
the 46th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN),
the flagship conference on fault-tolerant systems.

State machine replication is a common approach to building fault-tolerant
systems \cite{Lam78, Sch90}. Participants in a replicated state machine system
form agreement on a sequence of transactions and apply them in sequence order
deterministically to reach the same state. With its simple yet effective
execution model, state machine replication is at the core of blockchain systems
\cite{baudet2019state, cachin2016architecture}. This approach provides a
configurable degree of availability but limits the achievable throughput of the
replicated service to what a single replica can process sequentially. In the
work \dynastar \cite{le2019dynastar}, Le \emph{et al.} proposed an approach to
scaling the performance of SMR by allowing the SMR system to partition the state
and reconfigure its data placement on-the-fly. \dynastar maintains a location
oracle with a global view of the application state. The oracle helps users
locate objects in the system and optimizes data placement for performance. A
detailed experimental evaluation with standard benchmarks has revealed
performance improvements of two orders of magnitude.
%Figure \ref{fig:tpcc} shows the
%performance evaluation of \dynastar with TPC-C benchmark. Figure
%\ref{fig:tpcc}(a) depicts the impact of partitioning on the performance of a
%system before and after an optimized partitioning configuration is applied.
%Figure \ref{fig:tpcc}(b) shows the scalability of \dynastar when increase the
%size of the system (adding more data and computational resources). This result
%suggests that by using the data of the oracle to come up with an optimized
%partitioning, scalable performance for SMR is achievable for real-world
%application.
%
%It's worth it to
% note that in a TPC-C benchmark, the average rate of multi-partition transactions
% is 15\

\subsection{Innovation potential and market review} 

This project's main goal is to develop an oracle service that analyzes
blockchain transactions to provide object information about placement and
economics. The service will answer several questions such as where objects and
smart contracts are located, where to place objects to optimize the partitioning
of the network to improve performance, or to minimize transaction costs.
Therefore, it is aimed to be the catalyst that supports the widespread adoption
of blockchain technologies.

Blockchain analysis is becoming increasingly important in the
cryptocurrency market \cite{blockchainanalysis}. Some blockchain monitoring and
intelligence platforms are now offering analytics tools and software for
investigating entities, individuals, and transactions interacting with a
blockchain \cite{chainalysis2020kyt, bloxy, blocmonitor}. Private companies use
blockchain analysis solutions to track their customers' transactions to learn more
information about them. Security and government firms use those solutions to
effectively identify money laundering operations, illicit activity and other
financial crimes. The information provided by our oracle service serves
different purposes. First, it provides a location mapping for smart contracts
and objects within and across partitions. This enables blockchain clients to
quickly locate to which partitions or blockchain they should send their
transactions. Second, the location mapping opens up possibilities for further
improvements, e.g., computing the optimized location for the upcoming
transactions and objects. Third, with the information of the execution cost and
time provided by our oracle service, the blockchain client can decide to
off-load expensive computation to a side-chain to optimize the cost. Our
main customers are blockchain developers and distributed application designers
whose main concerns are about the scalability and cost efficiency of the
blockchain or its applications.

% With the on-chain component in the form of smart contract, our proposed system
% could be integrated to existing blockchain systems easily without any change in
% the blockchain protocol. 

% In an analysis in \cite{fynn2020move}, the author performed an extensive study
% on the impact of partitioning Ethereum blockchain. The study showed that even on
% a workload that was not created for a sharded system, an optimized partitioning
% scheme could achieve a rate of less than ten percents of cross partition
% transaction. 

Figure \ref{fig:transaction-fee} shows the mean value in USD of transaction
fees in the first six months of the year 2020 \cite{transactionfee}. This data
suggests that the average fee for executing an ordinary transaction on the Stellar
network is 1,000 times cheaper than on Ethereum Classic network, and is 100,000
times cheaper than running on Ethereum. If this information is available at the
time of execution, the blockchain can make an effective decision of where to
execute the transaction. However, it does make two important assumptions: (i)
the transaction is executable on all parties (i.e., there is a smart contract of
this transaction type available on both blockchains). (ii) there exists a move
operation that could send the necessary data from one contract to another (such
primitive was proposed in \cite{fynn2020move}).

Our proposed service could be quickly and easily integrated with existing
blockchains, DApps, or non-blockchain-based applications. Our solution doesn't
require any changes in the blockchain code, and therefore makes the integration simple without
hassle. The system is accessible in different ways. On-chain smart contracts or
DApps can request necessary information by issuing a call to our on-chain
components. Non-blockchain based applications can also access our data with
REST API. In addition, the design of our system is flexible enough to add
support for new blockchain systems.

Our main source of revenue is from blockchain users. Users will be
charged based on the time it takes to execute their queries. This time is
calculated from the time our computational unit begins executing the query until
it returns. The price depends on the maximum amount of memory that users are
willing to pay (e.g., a query for the location of objects results in
a lower cost than a query for an optimized location that takes more time and
resources to calculate). With our pay-per-call pricing model, the users only pay
for the queries that they run. This payment model has several benefits. There is
no entry barrier for users, no commitment required, and it offers the users
more flexibility around the services they want, and when they want them. For
instance, the application could decide to cache some queries results once in a
while for further usages to optimize costs.

\subsection{Implementation strategy}
\label{sec:strategy}

To fulfill the goals of the project, the proposed system needs to address
the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
      \item The system should be able to work with a number of different
      blockchains. While most of the existing blockchains share the core
      principles, their implementations and data structures are different. The
      system should have an abstraction to standardize the communication
      with different blockchains, simplifying the process of adding support for
      new blockchains.
      \item The integration with existing blockchains and DApps should be
      simple. Ideally, the deployment of the system on existing blockchains
      should be "plug-and-play", without introducing any changes in the
      protocol of the blockchain. 
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} presents the overall architecture of our proposed
oracle service. The core components of the system are divided in two parts: the
on-chain smart contract component and the off-chain service component. The
on-chain smart contract (OSC) is a set of smart contracts that are developed
separately for each supported blockchain. The OSC plays the roles of the
interface of the service, receives requests from other contracts in the form of
contract calls, and dispatches those requests to the off-chain component. The
OSC is also responsible for computing the fee of each request. Figure
\ref{fig:contract} proposes an example of the OSC in the form of Ethereum's
smart contract. The off-chain component consists of a computational unit (CU)
and a set of blockchain analyzers. The analyzers monitor the blockchains by
actively fetching and analyzing the transaction history to aggregate multiple
metrics of a standard blockchain, for example, the location of contracts and
objects in the case of movement, the average execution cost, or the pending
transactions count. The CU is a set of computational nodes that serves requests
by historical data fetched by the analyzers. Upon receiving requests from user
smart contracts, the OSC validates the requests and forwards those requests to
the CU. The CU queries the data from the backlog and replies to the OSC. Once
receiving the response from CU, the OSC calculates the fee for the request, and
send back the data to the user smart contracts.

\subsection{Project plan}
The project plan will divide the implementation strategy described in Section
\ref{sec:strategy} into three phases. Figure \ref{fig:plan} identifies the major
tasks and milestones for each phase.

\textbf{Phase 1: Developing off-chain component.} In this phase, we will to
develop an abstraction that helps standardize the monitoring process for the
blockchain analyzers. With this abstraction, we aim to implement analyzers for
at least three existing blockchains. We will also implement the computational
unit in this phase. The outcome of this phase is the fully functioning off-chain
component.

\textbf{Phase 2: Developing on-chain smart contracts.} Similar to Phase 1, we
will develop an abstraction for the interface for the service in the form of smart
contracts. Then we will implement this abstraction on at least three different
blockchains.

\textbf{Phase 3: Deploying and evaluating.} We will deploy the system on the supported
blockchains and start the evaluation process. To benchmark the system, we will develop a
sample DApps that could leverage the information of the oracle to make an optimized
decision. The evaluation will consider the scalability of the blockchain, as
well as the financial benefits based on the hints of the oracle service.

\textbf{Risks.} The proposed project is adventurous, as with any research
proposal, carries with it a certain amount of uncertainty. In this project, some
use cases of cost-efficient are based on the assumption of the existence of a move
protocol that enables the transferring of smart contracts and objects from one
blockchain to another. Although such primitive was presented in a recent work
\cite{fynn2020move} that allows the moving of a smart contract between Ethereum
and Burrow, developing and integrating such protocol to our system
may require a considerable amount of time and effort. To mitigate this risk, we will
collaborate with Fynn Enrique, the main author of that work, to help us with the
integration.
