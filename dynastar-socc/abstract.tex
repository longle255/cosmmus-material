Classic state machine replication (SMR) does not scale well, since
each replica must execute every command.  To address this problem,
several systems have investigated the use of state partitioning in the
context of SMR, allowing client commands to be executed on a subset of
replicas. Prior approaches range from completely static schemes, which do not
adapt as workloads change, to dynamic schemes, which move data on-demand.


This paper presents DynaStar, a new dynamic partitioning scheme for
scaling state machine replication. In contrast to prior dynamic
schemes, DynaStar uses a centralized oracle to maintain a global view
of workload and inform heuristics about data placement. Using this
oracle, DynaStar is able to adapt to workload changes over time,
while also minimizing the number of state moves. The result is a
practical technique that achieves close to optimal throughput.
