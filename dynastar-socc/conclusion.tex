In this paper we present \dynastar, a partitioning strategy for scalable state machine replication.
\dynastar is inspired by DS-SMR, a decentralized dynamic scheme proposed by Long et al.~\cite{hoang2016}.
Differently from DS-SMR, however, \dynastar performs well in workloads that exhibit strong and weak locality.
In the presence of strong locality, it converges more quickly than DS-SMR; in the presence of weak locality, it largely outperforms DS-SMR.
The key insights of \dynastar are to build a workload graph on-the-fly and use an optimized partitioning of the workload graph, computed with an online graph partitioner, to decide how to efficiently move state variables.
The paper describes how one can turn this conceptually simple idea into a system that sports performance close to an optimal (but impractical) scalable system.
